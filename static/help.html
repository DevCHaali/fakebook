                Facebook.com on mobile browsers is in the process of being updated. Weâ€™ll be adding updated instructions to the Help Center for features that are available on mobile browsers. Check back over the coming months. 
If you see a message when you log in that says "Facebook will be back soon," this usually means we're making an improvement to the database your account is stored on. While this process won't affect your account, you temporarily won't be able to access the site.
We don't do site maintenance on all databases at the same time. It's possible that your friends will be able to access Facebook while your account is still unavailable.
